# AbstractMachine
An interactive educational Android application that demonstrates how computers work. Users can see a live computer in action and drill down to parts of interest.

This project is intentionally developed to use pure text (Java for core logic and Android for UI) and NO image resources to develop Android UI skills, e.g. custom Views. Some classes/interfaces are created more for informational purposes than functional. 

This project is still in progress.
